# 텍스트 분석

## 문서 군집화 소개와 실습(Opinion Review 데이터 세트)




### 문서 군집화 개념

문서 군집화(Document Clustering)는 비슷한 텍스트 구성의 문서를 군집화(Clustering)하는 것이다. <br> 문서 군집화는 동일한 군집에 속하는 문서를 같은 카테고리 소속으로 분류할 수 있으므로 앞에서 소개한 텍스트 분류 기반의 문서 분류와 유사하다. <br> 하지만 텍스트 분류 기반의 문서 분류는 사전에 결정 카테고리 값을 가진 학습 데이터 세트가 필요한 데 반해, 문서 군집화는 학습 데이터 세트가 필요없는 비지도학습 기반으로 동잗한다.


문서군집화는 문서를 피처 벡터화한 데이터 세트에 군집화 알고리즘을 적용하여 수행할 수 있으며, 일반적으로 K-Means 군집화가 적용될 수 있다.




### Opinion Review 데이터 세트를 이용한 문서 군집화 수행하기


#### <실습>

```python
import pandas as pd
import glob ,os
import warnings 
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 700)
 
path = r'C:\Users\82106\Test_project\PerfectGuide-master\8장\data\OpinosisDataset1.0\OpinosisDataset1.0\topics'

# path로 지정한 디렉토리 밑에 있는 모든 .data 파일들의 파일명을 리스트로 취합
all_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(path, "*.data"))    
filename_list = []
opinion_text = []

# 개별 파일들의 파일명은 filename_list 리스트로 취합, 
# 개별 파일들의 파일내용은 DataFrame로딩 후 다시 string으로 변환하여 opinion_text 리스트로 취합 
for file_ in all_files:
    # 개별 파일을 읽어서 DataFrame으로 생성 
    df = pd.read_table(file_,index_col=None, header=0,encoding='latin1')

    
    # 절대경로로 주어진 file 명을 가공. 만일 Linux에서 수행시에는 아래 \\를 / 변경. 
    # 맨 마지막 .data 확장자도 제거
    filename_ = file_.split('\\')[-1]
    filename = filename_.split('.')[0]

    #파일명 리스트와 파일내용 리스트에 파일명과 파일 내용을 추가. 
    filename_list.append(filename)
    opinion_text.append(df.to_string())

# 파일명 리스트와 파일내용 리스트를  DataFrame으로 생성
document_df = pd.DataFrame({'filename':filename_list, 'opinion_text':opinion_text})
document_df.head()
```

**TfidfVectorizer의 tokenizer인자로 사용될 lemmatization 어근 변환 함수를 설정.**


```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import nltk
import string

remove_punct_dict = dict((ord(punct), None) for punct in string.punctuation)
lemmar = WordNetLemmatizer()

# 입력으로 들어온 token단어들에 대해서 lemmatization 어근 변환. 
def LemTokens(tokens):
    return [lemmar.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]

# TfidfVectorizer 객체 생성 시 tokenizer인자로 해당 함수를 설정하여 lemmatization 적용
# 입력으로 문장을 받아서 stop words 제거-> 소문자 변환 -> 단어 토큰화 -> lemmatization 어근 변환. 
def LemNormalize(text):
    return LemTokens(nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower().translate(remove_punct_dict)))
```

**TF-IDF 기반 Vectorization 적용 및 KMeans 군집화 수행.** 
* Stemming과 Lemmatization 같은 어근 변환은 TfidfVectorizer에서 직접 지원하진 않으나 tokenizer 파라미터에 커스텀 어근 변환 함수를 적용하여 어근 변환을 수행할 수 있음
* TfidfVectorizer 생성자의 tokenizer인자로 위에서 생성 LemNormalize 함수 설정.


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf_vect = TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=LemNormalize, stop_words='english' , \
                             ngram_range=(1,2), min_df=0.05, max_df=0.85 )

#opinion_text 컬럼값으로 feature vectorization 수행
feature_vect = tfidf_vect.fit_transform(document_df['opinion_text'])

```


```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# 5개 집합으로 군집화 수행. 예제를 위해 동일한 클러스터링 결과 도출용 random_state=0 
km_cluster = KMeans(n_clusters=5, max_iter=10000, random_state=0)
km_cluster.fit(feature_vect)
cluster_label = km_cluster.labels_
cluster_centers = km_cluster.cluster_centers_
```


```python
km_cluster.labels_
```
